Purpose: 
----------------------
This program is a simple rational number calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations on rational numbers. It allows you to input a rational number expression and calculates the result. The rational numbers are represented as pairs of integers, where the first integer represents the numerator and the second integer represents the denominator.

Functionality:
------------------------
- make_variables(): Clears all variables and prepares for a new input.
- take_input(): Takes user input for the rational number expression.
- is_valid(): Validates the input expression for any invalid characters or syntax errors.
- solve(): Breaks down the expression into individual blocks and performs the arithmetic operations.
- print_solution(): Prints the final simplified result of the expression.
- start(): Starts the calculation process by calling the necessary functions based on user input.

Note:
------------------------
The code uses the C++ Standard Template Library (STL) and requires the <bits/stdc++.h> header, which may not be available in all C++ compilers.
